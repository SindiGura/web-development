                <h3>Fast Introduction</h3>
                <pre>  
My name is Sindi, I am a second year computer science student.
Besides coding, I love learning about mythology, astrophysics, 
and all the connection in-between (there is a lot more than meets 
the eye)

I was born in Durres, Albania in February, 2004. Besides its long, sandy beaches, Albania is famous for its “Blue Eye”. </pre>

                    <pre>
“An old man took a donkey and loaded sacks of straw on it and went near to a cave 
where a giant snake found shelter. The old man set fire to the straw as soon as 
he noticed the snake approaching. The beast swallowed the donkey that continued 
to burn inside his body. The beast called in pain for his mother, the sea, and his
sisters the rivers to come to his rescue, but they were not fast enough. The snake 
in agony crossed the mountain where he left his trace and upon reaching the 
place where the Blue Eye spring is now found, his big eye fell and water 
overflew the land surface and still today, the giant snake’s blue eye continues to cry.”

Stargazing is natural, even if it proves difficult while studying in downtown Toronto. 
There is one star that always stands out, and its not even a star at all. The planet Venus is the first morning and evening star so watch out for it!

                    <summary>Venus and Aphrodite, Greek Origins</summary>
                    <pre> 
Venus, or Ahprodite in greek mythology, was born from the white foam produced by the severed 
Uranus, the personification of heaven, after his son Cronus threw him into the sea. 
Hence, the goddess's name comes from the Greek word aphros, meaning “foam.”

                    <summary>Venus and Aphrodite, Albanian Origins</summary>
                    <pre> 
In Albanian, the word “Aphrodite” or “Aferdita” can be broken into ‘Afer’ (close) and ‘dita’ 
(day). Thus, a literal translation of ‘Close to day’, representing its role as the morning star.

        <div id="hiddenElement">Last night, I tried star gazing for the first time, and it was simply magical. As I lay under the dark 
            night sky, I saw constellations come to life like connect-the-dots stories. The Milky Way, a shimmering 
            river of stars, left me in awe. It's a humbling reminder of our place in the universe and a chance to connect 
            with the cosmos in a way that words can't truly capture. I highly recommend trying it for yourself.</div>
