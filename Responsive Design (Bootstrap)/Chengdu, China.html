                    <p class="text-center">
                        China's tea culture originated in Chengdu. The earliest tea trade was in 
                        Chengdu, dating back more than 3,000 years. Chengdu has more teahouses 
                        than any other city in the world. It is said that people in Chengdu 
                        can drink the equivalent of up to seven Hangzhou West Lakes 
                        (6.38square kilometers) of tea every year.

                            attraction when visiting Chengdu. If you want to explore the Chinese 
                            Buddhist culture, the Leshan Giant Buddha is no doubt an ideal place 
                            to witness the process of China’s peak period of Buddhism. Built 
                            during the Tang Dynasty, this huge Buddha is the biggest stone 
                            Buddha sculpture carved from a cliff. You can experience a strong 
                            feeling of solemnity and peace when you are next to the Buddha’s feet.
